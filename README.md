# Restaurant-Time-Series-Model
## Overview
Welcome to the Restaurant Time Series Model project! This repository contains the implementation of a time series forecasting model specifically designed for restaurant data.
## Key Features
- Time Series Forecasting: Implemented a robust time series forecasting model to predict future trends in restaurant-related metrics.

- Data Preprocessing: Meticulously cleaned and prepared the raw restaurant data for effective time series analysis.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Utilized state-of-the-art time series algorithms to train the model and rigorously evaluated its performance using appropriate metrics.

- Interactive Visualizations: Created visualizations to showcase the model's predictions and provide insights into the forecasted restaurant metrics.

## Project Structure
- data/: Contains the raw and preprocessed restaurant data.

- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- src/: Python scripts for the implementation of the time series forecasting model.
